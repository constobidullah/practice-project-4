                        <p><strong>Question : What is the difference between var let and const ? </strong><br>

                            <strong>Answer :</strong>
                            Variables declared with var and const are scoped to the immediate function body.
                            Variables declared with the var keyword are hoisted. Hoisting means that the variable can be
                            accessed in their enclosing scope even before they are declared.
                            Variables declared with the let keyword are block-scoped, which means the variables will
                            have scope to the immediate enclosing block.

                            </strong><br>

                            <strong>Answer :</strong>
                            Unlike regular functions, arrow functions do not have their own this . The value of this
                            inside an arrow function remains the same throughout the lifecycle of the function and is
                            always bound to the value of this in the closest non-arrow parent function.

                        <p><strong>Question : why will you use tamplate string ? </strong><br>

                            <strong>Answer :</strong>
                            Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us
                            insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate
                            like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and
                            contain dynamic elements.
